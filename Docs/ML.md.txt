### ML Model:
Following are the steps thats been peformed for predicting the house price around Austin Area.
1. Drop the following columns as there are not helpful for prediction
    1. homeImage.
    1. numOfPhotos.
    1. numPriceChanges.
    1. description.
    1. streetAddress.
    1. latitude.
    1. longitude.
    1. latestPriceSource.

1. Scatter plot between Living Area (sqft) vs SalePrice

1. Linear Regression for the house price prediction.

1. Scatter plot between Year Built vs SalePrice.

1. Linear Model on Year Built and House Price Prediction.

Summary:
1. Using Linear Regression ML, the data points are not along the linear line, so its very hard to predict the house price using the linear regression using the Living Area.
1. On a second thought used Year Built instead of the Living Area, same results hard to predict the House Price using Linear Regression.

Need to use other Model like log Regression or RandomForest Regression to predict housing price.
