Final project 


### ML Model:
Following are the steps thats been peformed for predicting the house price around Austin Area.
1. Drop the following columns as there are helpful for prediction
    1. homeImage.
    1. numOfPhotos.
    1. numPriceChanges.
    1. description.
    1. streetAddress.
    1. latitude.
    1. longitude.
    1. latestPriceSource.

1. Scatter plot between Living Area (sqft) vs SalePrice
1. Linear Regression for the house price prediction.

Based on the Linear Regression line, the data points are not along the linear line, so its very hard to predict the house price using the linear regression.
We might need to explore some other models.
