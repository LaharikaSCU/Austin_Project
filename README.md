## **Our Topic:** 

Austin Housing Market Predictions

## **Reason the topic was selected:**

Austin, Texas has been the America's hottest housing market in 2020 - 21. The growing high-tech employment from companies like Apple, Tesla, Oracle and other start-ups are causing home sales and prices in the Austin real estate market to jump. Austin is located in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, surrounded by lakes and rivers, including the Colorado River. Austinâ€™s booming job market, beautiful weather, scenic views, plentiful nightlife options, diverse dining scene and outdoor experiences are some of the reasons why professionals are flocking to the capital city of Texas.

Also, majority of our team-mates are from Austin and others have shown interest in analyzing the real estate trends in Austin. Hence, we chose this interesting topic for analysis.
